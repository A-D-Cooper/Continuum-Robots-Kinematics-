# Continuum-Robot-Kinematics-
## Continuum Robot Kinematics are modeled as Circular arcs
#### Continuum robot are considered as 'n' circular arcs and useing these are its kinematics are modeled. We can use robot specific parameters and convert them to these circular parameters and then use those to map kinematics.

## Tendon Driven Continuum Robot
#### Tendon driven continuum robots utilize circular discs, tendons and a backbone (usually made of nitinol). Circular discs are connected with threads and seperate threads are used for seperate segments. We need the change in the length of each thread (measured relative to first disc) to compute the kinematics.

## Concentic Tube Continuum Robots
#### Concentric tube continnum Robots use precurved hollow tubes made out of a flexible material. These tubes' curvature is affected by the curvature of tube inside them and we need to account for that when we model these.
